![Before Formatting with Prettier](frontend/public/images/beforePrittier.jpg)
Before using Prettier, some of the HTML code in this project had indentation errors, making it harder to read and maintain.

After running Prettier, all the HTML code was automatically formatted with proper indentation, spacing, and consistent styling. This makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and more professional.
