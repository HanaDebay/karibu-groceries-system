so we know that localStorage and sessionStorage are web storage mechanisms used to save key-value pairs directly in a user's browser.
they share the same API 
differ primarily in how long they keep data 
and their accessibility accros tabs 
so based on this which method is perfect or good for our kgl project 
am expriencing because i used localStorage differnt users in same browser different tab are able to login and they are using the same token ?
